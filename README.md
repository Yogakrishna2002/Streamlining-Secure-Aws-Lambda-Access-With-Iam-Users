✅ Project Overview
This project focuses on IAM-based security & access control for AWS Lambda, ensuring secure operations and best practices for monitoring AWS activities.

🔹 Key Components
AWS Lambda (Serverless execution)
IAM Roles & Policies (Granular access control)
S3 (Secure storage operations)
SNS & SES (Notification & email services)
CloudWatch (Monitoring & logging)
🎯 Goal
Secure Lambda function access by implementing strict IAM-based policies and ensuring best security practices in AWS services.

🔹 IAM Policies Used
S3 Upload-Only Policy → Restricts access to listing buckets & uploading files (prevents deletion).
SES Read-Only Policy → Allows viewing SES data but no modifications.
SNS Read-Only & Publish Policy → Grants access to list topics & publish messages.
🔹 Implementation Highlights
✅ AWS Lambda function for monitoring & security
✅ IAM policy-based secure access control
✅ S3, SNS, and SES integrations for real-time tracking
✅ CloudWatch logs for detailed monitoring
🛠 Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Attach the required IAM policies to your AWS Lambda function.
2️⃣ Ensure the Lambda function has the correct IAM role assigned.
3️⃣ Monitor activities using AWS CloudWatch.

🔥 Why This Matters?
🔐 Enhanced Security → Prevents unauthorized access
⚡ AWS Best Practices → Uses least privilege IAM policies
📊 Better Monitoring → Tracks real-time AWS activity# Streamlining-Secure-Aws-Lambda-Access-With-Iam-Users
